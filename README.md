# Adapter Implementation

## Description
In this implementation of the adapter design pattern, a list of employees is imported and then a third party tool (ReportingTool) is used to add a fancy header and footer to the list while printing it. To specify further, letâ€™s say that an internal SAP system returns a list of employees as a string array. The third-party tool expects a list of strings though. Therefore an adapter is needed to enable the user to use the library with a string array.
